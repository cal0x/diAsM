Disassembler

Currently this tool is a small disassembler for Mac OS X<br>
For example dump the output in a text file:
> cal0x:diAsM cal0x$ ./diAsM diAsM  >> dis.txt

If I have time I will make a version for windows GUI with the following features:


###Features coming soon ( Windows Edition )
	1. Disassembler:
		- 0xAddress: ASM Code
		
	2. Hex Dumper:
		- 0xAddress: Hex Code
		
	3. Debugger:
		- Set breakpoints
		- Read register
		
	4. Write Memory:
		- Write bytes
		
The debugger will be very easy like I explain it here:

And I show it in this pseudo code:
